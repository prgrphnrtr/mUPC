## Rule 262 - Public access to the register

1. Without prejudice to Articles  58 and 60(1) of the Agreement and subject to Rules  190.1, 194.5, 196.1, 197.4, 199.1, 207.7, 209.4, 315.2 and 365.2, and following, where applicable, redaction of personal data within the meaning of Regulation (EU)  2016/679 and confidential information according to paragraph 2  
	- (a) decisions and orders made by the Court shall be published,  
	- (b) written pleadings and evidence, lodged at the Court and recorded by the Registry shall be available to the public upon reasoned request to the Registry; the decision is taken by the judge-rapporteur after consulting the parties.  

2. A party may request that certain information of written pleadings or evidence be kept confidential and provide specific reasons for such confidentiality. To this end content of the register is made publicly available according to paragraph 1 (b) only 14 days after it has been available to all recipients. The Registrar shall ensure that beyond this time period information subject of a request for confidentiality shall not be made available pending an Application pursuant to paragraph  3 or an appeal pursuant to Rule 220.2. When a party lodges a request that parts of written pleadings or evidence shall be kept confidential, he shall also provide copies of  the said documents with the relevant parts redacted when making the request.   

3. A member of the public may lodge an Application with the Court for an order that any information excluded from public access pursuant to paragraph  2 may be made available to the applicant.   

4. The Application shall contain:   
	- (a) details of the information alleged to be confidential , so far as possible ; 
	- (b) the grounds upon which the applicant believes the reasons for confidentiality should not be accepted ;  and   
	- (c) the purpose for which the information is needed.  

5. The Court shall invite written comments from the parties prior to making any order.  

6. The Court shall allow the Application unless legitimate reasons given by the party concerned for the confidentiality of the information outweigh the interest of the applicant to access such information.   

7. The Registrar shall as soon as practicable take all such steps with regard to access to the register as may be necessary to give effect to an order of the Court under this Rule.
