	- (b) any available written evidence relied on ; 
	- (c) the arguments of law, including the reasons why any Application for provisional measures should be rejected.  

4. The defendant or defendants filing the Protective letter shall pay the fee for filing a Protective letter, in accordance with Part  6. Rule 15.2 shall apply mutatis mutandis. 

5. The Registry shall as soon as practicable examine whether the requirements of paragraphs 2(a) to (f) and 4 have been complied with. If these requirements have been complied with, the Registry shall as soon as practicable:  
	- (a) record the date of receipt and assign a number to the Protective letter ; 
	- (b) subject to paragraph  7, record the Protective letter in the register ; 
	- (c) provide details of the Protective letter to all divisions ; and  
	- (d) where an Application for provisional measures has already been lodged, inform the panel or the single judge dealing with the Application about the filing of the Protective letter.

6. If the defendant has not complied with the requirements of paragraph  2 the Registry shall as soon as practicable invite the defendant to:  
	- (a) correct the deficiencies within 14 days  of service of such notification ; and  
	- (b) where applicable, pay the fee referred to in paragraph 4.  

7. The protective letter shall not be publicly available on the register until it has been forwarded to the applicant pursuant to paragraph  8.  

8. Where an Application for provisional measures is subsequently lodged the Registrar shall forward a copy of the protective letter to the panel or judge appointed under Rule 208 together with the Application for provisional measures and shall forward a copy to the applicant  as soon as practicable.  

9. If no Application for provisional measures has been lodged within six months from the date of receipt of the Protective letter, the Protective letter shall be removed from the register unless the person who has lodged the Protective letter has prior to the expiry of such period applied for an extension of six months and paid a fee for the extension in accordance with Part 6. Further extensions may be obtained on further payments of the fee.
