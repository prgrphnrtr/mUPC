2. The Registrar shall mark the status of the Application to opt out or withdraw the opt -out entered in the register as subject to an Application for removal. The Registrar shall decide on the Application for removal as soon as practicable. If the final decision is to remove the Application to opt out or withdrawal of an opt -out the Registrar shall delete it in the register.

If the Application for review is allowable, the President of the Court of Appeal shall order the Registrar to remove the opt-out or the withdrawal of the opt-out.
