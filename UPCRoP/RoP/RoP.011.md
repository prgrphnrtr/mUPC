## Rule 11 - Settlement

1. At any stage of the proceedings, if the Court is of the opinion that the dispute is suitable for a settlement, it may propose that the parties make use of the facilities of the Patent Mediation and Arbitration Centre (“the Centre”) in order to settle or to explore a settlement of the dispute.  In particular , the judge-rapporteur  shall during the interim procedure, especially  at an interim conference in accordance with Rule 104(d) , explore with the parties the possibility of a settlement, including through mediation and/or arbitration, using the facilities of the Centre.  Parties w ho choose mediation in an attempt to settle a dispute are subsequently not prevented from initiating judicial proceedings before the Court in relation to that dispute by the expiry of limitation or prescription periods during the mediation process , which  will stay the limitation or prescription periods until the end of the mediation process . If mediation proceedings are terminated without a dispute settlement agreement, the period shall continue to run from that moment.  

2. Pursuant to Rule 365 the Court shall , if requested by the parties,  by decision confirm the terms of any settlement  or arb itral award by consent (irrespective of whether it was reached using the facilities of the Centre or otherwise) , including a term which obliges the patent owner to limit, surrender or agree to the revocation of a patent or not to assert it against the othe r party and/or third parties.  The parties may agree on costs to be awarded or may request the Court to decide on costs to be awarded in accordance with Rules  150 to 156 mutatis mutandis.

3. Save for the purpose of enforcing the terms of any such settlement  agreement by any person no opinion expressed, suggestion made, proposal put forward, concession made or document drawn up for the purposes of settlement may be relied on as evidence by the Court or the parties in proceedings before the Court or any other court unless such matter was expressed to be made on an open basis and freely disclosable to the Court or any other court.
