## Rule 213 - Revocation of provisional measures

1. The Court shall ensure that provisional measures are revoked or otherwise cease to have effect, upon request of the defendant, without prejudice to the damages which may be claimed, if, within a time period not exceeding 31 calendar days or 20 working days , whichever is the longer, from the date specified in the Courtâ€™s order, the applicant does not start proceedings on the merits of the case before the Court.  When specifying the date, the Court shall take due account, where applicable, of the date on which  the Report referred to in Rule 196.4 shall be presented.  

2. Where provisional measures are revoked, or where they lapse due to any act or omission by the applicant, or where it is subsequently found that there has been no infringement or threat of infring ement of the patent, the Court may order the applicant, upon request of the defendant, to provide the defendant with appropriate compensation for any injury caused by those measures [Rule 354.2].
