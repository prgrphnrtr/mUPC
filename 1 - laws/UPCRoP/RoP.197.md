2. Where measures to preserve evidence are ordered without the defendant having been heard, Rule 195 shall apply mutatis mutandis  to the oral hearing without the presence of the defendant. In such cases, the defendant shall be given notice, immediately at the time of the execution of the measures.

	- (a) the reasons why the order to preserve evidence shall be revoked or modified ; and  
	- (b) the facts and evidence relied on.  

4. The Court shall order an oral hearing to review the order without delay.  Rule 195 shall apply.  The Court may modify, revoke or con firm the order. In case the order is modified or revoked the Court shall oblige the persons to whom confidential information has been disclosed to keep this i nformation confidential [Rule 196.1] .
