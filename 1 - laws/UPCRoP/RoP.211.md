	- (a) injunctions against a defendant;  
	- (b) the seizure or delivery up of the goods suspected of infringing a patent right so as to prevent their entry into or movement within the channels of commerce;  
	- (c) if an applicant demonstrates circumstances likely to endanger the recovery of damages, a precautio nary seizure of the movable and immovable property of the defendant, including the blocking of his bank accounts and other assets;  
	- (d) an interim award of costs.  

2. In taking its decision the Court may require the applicant to provide reasonable evidence to satisfy the Court with a sufficient degree of certainty that the applicant is entitled to commence proceedings pursuant to Article  47, that the patent in question is valid and that his right is being infringed, or that such infringement is imminent.
